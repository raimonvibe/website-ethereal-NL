* Built with SCSS for more maintainable styling.
* Minimal, clean JavaScript for page interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser.

   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory

   ```
3. (Optional) If build tooling (SCSS compile, etc) is used, install dependencies:

## File Structure

```
/assets/
   /images/        ← ethereal style visuals
index.html         ← Main home page (Dutch)
LegalNotice.html   ← Legal page
PrivacyNotice.html ← Privacy page
sitemap.xml        ← Sitemap
vercel.json        ← Vercel config (if used)

## Customisation Guide

* **Colour palette**: Modify SCSS variables to adjust primary, secondary or accent colours.
* **Images**: Replace the image files inside `/assets/images/` with your own visuals to match your personal style or brand.
* **Fonts / Icons**: Edit the `<head>` in `index.html` to include your chosen fonts or icon set.
* **Language**: Since the site is Dutch (“NL”), update content strings accordingly (or adapt for other locales if desired).
* **Deploying**: If using a hosting service (e.g., Vercel), connect the repository and push the changes — the site will rebuild and publish automatically.

## Why this project?

* Provides a refined, elegant website template tailored for Dutch audiences or personal portfolios.
* Demonstrates modern responsive web design techniques (flexible layouts, media queries, mobile-first) within a stylish aesthetic.
* Gives you a strong base to launch a small website, portfolio, or campaign quickly and with minimal fuss.
